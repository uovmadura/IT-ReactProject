## Project Overview

The portal will serve as an information hub for students, enabling them to view and manage their academic details, schedules, grades, and other important information. The main objective of this SPA (Single Page Application) project is to implement a seamless user experience using modern web development practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Editor**: VS Code
- **Backend (future integration)**: TBD (if applicable)
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - React Router for navigation
  - Axios for making HTTP requests
  - Styled-components (or CSS/SCSS) for styling
  - Other necessary packages (to be defined in `package.json`)

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or if you're using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:
    To run the app in development mode, use the following command:
    ```bash
